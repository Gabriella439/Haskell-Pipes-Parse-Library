# Pipes-Parse

`pipes-parse` builds upon
[the `pipes` library](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Pipes-Library) to
provide shared streaming parsing utilities.

## Quick start

* Install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)
* `cabal install pipes-parse`
* `cabal install lens-family-core`

Then fire up `ghci`:

    Prelude> import Pipes
    Prelude Pipes> import Pipes.Parse as Parse
    Prelude Pipes Parse> import Lens.Family.State.Strict as Lens

... and draw the first group of consecutive equal elements:

    Prelude Pipes Parse Lens> evalStateT (zoom group drawAll) (each [1, 1, 2, 3])
    [1,1]

The official tutorial is on
[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-parse).

## Features

* *Leftovers*: Save unused input for later consumption

* *Leftover propagation*: Leftovers are propagated backwards perfectly

* *Connect and Resume*: Use `StateT` to save unused input for later

* *Termination Safety*: Detect and recover from end of input

## Outline

`pipes-parse` provides the core idioms for how to parse streams using `pipes`.
Stream-specific parsers are provided in downstream libraries, such as
`pipes-bytestring` and `pipes-text`.

## Development Status

The core mechanism behind `pipes-parse` is stable.  I may accept requests for
additional generic parsers, but the central idioms will not change.  Most
development work concentrates on downstream libraries to provide stream-specific
parsing utilities.

## Community Resources

Use the same resources as the core `pipes` library to learn more, contribute, or
request help:

* [Haskell wiki page](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pipes)

* [Mailing list](mailto:haskell-pipes@googlegroups.com) ([Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/haskell-pipes))

## How to contribute

* Build derived libraries

* Write `pipes-parse` tutorials
